# Customer-Churn-Predictor
This repository contains code and documentation for the Customer Churn Predictor project. It develops a predictive analytics model to identify potential churn in subscription services, aiding businesses in implementing effective retention strategies using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The Customer Churn Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to predict customer churn for subscription-based services. By leveraging various data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple machine learning algorithms, the project aims to provide actionable insights to analysts and stakeholders to minimize revenue loss and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and scaling data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summary, feature analysis, and visualization to understand data characteristics.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementation and evaluation of various models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization using grid search and randomized search to improve model performance.
- Web Application: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to input customer data and predict churn probability.
